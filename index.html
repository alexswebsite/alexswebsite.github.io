            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            
            <p>  I have skills as of for sports for Baseball, softball, and swimming. 
                I also know How to bake/cook.  I am very good at adapting myself to 
                work with other people in their own environment. A little known fact 
                about myslef is that I was born a lefty but as I grew up my mom has
                taught me to do everything with my right. Although, I pretty much do 
                everything with my right hand I still eat food with my left, but I can
                also do it with my right.

                read books on my free time, especially when I start stressing or 
                freaking out. I also have learned sign language at school and at my own time.
