            <h2> Interests in highschools!</h2>
            <p> For highschool I would liked to go to MIlikan or Wilson.If I got to 
                Milikan I would like to be in the  Quest program and my foreign language 
                would be spansh in spanish learners or advance spanish. If I was going to 
                Wilson high school I would love to be in the Medical and biotechnology 
                since it would help me in the the medical organization that would fall 
                into the dentistry organization. For my foreign language it would be the 
                exact same thing.
