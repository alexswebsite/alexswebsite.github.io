            <h2>School</h2>
            
            <p> Millikan Quest is a very stressful course. It doesn't have the best teachers
            ever. Especially their 9th grade science teacher. Although it does help you 
            understand how crucial the next few years are going to be escpecially college.

            <h2> Highschool</h2>
            <p> I am currently going to Millikan Highschool in Quest, and are still taking Graphic
                Design clases. Although the career path I want to got to does not nearly 
                involve coding or photoshop skills I still want to improve it and make it 
                a hobby of mine. Making website are really cool and easy to make.
