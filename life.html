            <h2>School</h2>
            
            <p> Millikan Quest is a very stressful course. It doesn't have the best teachers
            ever. Especially their 9th grade science teacher. Although it does help you 
            understand how crucial the next few years are going to be escpecially college.

            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p> I love my friends so much. They help me go through some very stressfull things. 
                I easily panic about small things that don't really matter and they help me so 
                much go through it. Especially when they ask how my day was and when they know
                something is wrong even when I don't tell them. One of the sad things is my 
                closest friend doesn't live near me so he doesn't go to school with me. But
                he's the one that talks to me the most and I love (as a friend) him so much
                for that. Thank you so much dude for being friends with a weirdo loser like me. 
                ( It is very hard for me to tell someone that I love them and putting this online 
                like this. So this really means a lot. <3) Love ya dude....

            <h2> Highschool</h2>
            <p> I am currently going to Millikan Highschool in Quest, and are still taking Graphic
                Design clases. Although the career path I want to got to does not nearly 
                involve coding or photoshop skills I still want to improve it and make it 
                a hobby of mine. Making website are really cool and easy to make.
