            <p>  My skills in softball are that I primarly
                play pitcher,second, and shortstop most of 
                the time. I have played softball for about 
               3  years. I am currently playing Frosh at 
                Millikan. I hope to play in college. Before
                I played softball I played baseball. I 
                absolutley loved playing baseball. I miss 
                playing baseball so much that when ever my 
                brothers had travel ball practice and I was 
                bored I too was going to practice with them. 
                Baseball and I guess softball are the love of 
                my life. <3
