            <h2>Reflection </h2>
            <p>  ATM has helped me alot with technology and working with all the new 
                technology that has me a lot through the three years in this program.
                What has also helped a lot was being in the Genius Bar Because I can 
                help many kids my age or even adults that need help with technology
                and much more. I has helped me a lot become more confident with 
                working in technology even though I may have made mistakes but that 
                has never made me stop trying to learn new things. </p>
