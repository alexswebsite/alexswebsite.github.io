            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p> I do not have soooo many friends, but I have the best friends in the world. 
                Although they may annoy me or put me in a bad mood, I know that they mean 
                all good. The sad thing is that one of my closest friends doesn't go to 
                school with me, nor do I see him. I have slowly been drifting for many 
                reasons. But I love him (as a friend) so much and I don't know how to 
                possibluy tell him with me not seeing him. luv ya dude <3. He's never 
                    gonna see this that why I'm writing it here. lol

            <h2> Highschool</h2>
            <p> I am currently going to Millikan Highschool in Quest, and are still taking Graphic
                Design clases. Although the career path I want to got to does not nearly 
                involve coding or photoshop skills I still want to improve it and make it 
                a hobby of mine. Making website are really cool and easy to make.
