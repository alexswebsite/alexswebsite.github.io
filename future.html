            <h2> Highschool</h2>
            <p> I am currently going to Millikan Highschool in Quest, and are still taking Graphic
                Design clases. Although the career path I want to got to does not nearly 
                involve coding or photoshop skills I still want to improve it and make it 
                a hobby of mine. Making website are really cool and easy to make.
